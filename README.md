# AWS_microservice: CRUD Operations on a NoSQL Database using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

## Description
This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in building full-stack applications that can perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on a non-SQL database. The front-end of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end utilizes API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB to handle data manipulation and storage. The project showcases the ability to design and implement a scalable and flexible system for managing data in a modern, cloud-based environment.

## Prerequisites
* A AWS account and access to the AWS Management Console
* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python
